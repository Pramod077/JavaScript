A customised product portfolio is created using the user selection option. 

As the user selects his or her choice options in the Acrobat PDF editor, the product image gets updated by hiding or showing selected features, i.e., according to drop-down options.

Images of those options are kept in layers.
Using a JavaScript-based OCGs library, we can show or hide the required layers.
